Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture
E-tivity 2: Neural Networks

This repository contains the code and documentation for E-tivity 2 on Neural Networks. In this E-tivity, we explore the implementation of a simple artificial neural network (ANN) for classification tasks. The tasks involve coding a Perceptron manually, implementing gradient descent, and utilizing Scikit-learn for a more complex ANN. The final task introduces a challenge where feature engineering is required for model fitting.
Instructions

Please follow the tasks outlined in the Jupyter notebook provided in this repository. The notebook covers the following tasks:

    Task 1: Coding a Perceptron (Manual Implementation)
        Implement a Perceptron with a single node and a sigmoid activation function.
        Write a group prediction function.
        Initialize the Perceptron with random weights and bias, run the data through it, and evaluate its accuracy.
        Plot the model's group predictions.

    Task 2: Coding a Perceptron (Gradient Descent)
        Implement a loss function using the sum of squared errors.
        Implement a model update function using gradient descent.
        Fit the model until satisfied with the performance.
        Evaluate the final model's accuracy and plot its predictions.

    Task 3: Scikit-learn
        Split the data into training and testing partitions.
        Define a multi-layer perceptron using Scikit-learn.
        Fit the model to the training data.
        Print the mean accuracy on the testing data.
        Plot the model's predictions on the testing data.

    Task 4: Model Fitting Challenge (Not to be publicly posted)
        Utilize feature engineering to fit an ANN to a challenging dataset.
