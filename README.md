# Neural-Networks

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for E-tivity 2 on Neural Networks. In this E-tivity, we explore the implementation of a simple artificial neural network (ANN) for classification tasks. The repository includes detailed instructions and code for different tasks related to neural networks.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Coding a Perceptron (Manual Implementation)
- Implement a Perceptron with a single node and a sigmoid activation function.
- Write a group prediction function.
- Initialize the Perceptron with random weights and bias, run the data through it, and evaluate its accuracy.
- Plot the model's group predictions.

### Task 2: Coding a Perceptron (Gradient Descent)
- Implement a loss function using the sum of squared errors.
- Implement a model update function using gradient descent.
- Fit the model until satisfied with the performance.
- Evaluate the final model's accuracy and plot its predictions.

### Task 3: Scikit-learn
- Split the data into training and testing partitions.
- Define a multi-layer perceptron using Scikit-learn.
- Fit the model to the training data.
- Print the mean accuracy on the testing data.
- Plot the model's predictions on the testing data.

### Task 4: Model Fitting Challenge (Not to be publicly posted)
- Utilize feature engineering to fit an ANN to a challenging dataset.

## Additional Information

- The code cell in the notebook generates a random dataset with features ùë•, ùë¶, and ùê∫ùëüùëúùë¢ùëù for classification tasks.
- Ensure you have the necessary Python modules installed, including NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, to run the code successfully.

   - Ran the data through the Perceptron and evaluated its accuracy.
   - Plotted the model's group predictions to visualize the results.

3. **Gradient Descent Perceptron Implementation:**
   - Developed a loss function using the sum of squared errors.
   - Implemented a model update function using gradient descent to optimize the weights.
   - Fitted the model until achieving satisfactory performance.
   - Evaluated the final model's accuracy and plotted its predictions.

4. **Using Scikit-learn:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing partitions.
   - Defined a multi-layer perceptron model using the Scikit-learn library.
   - Trained the model on the training data.
   - Printed the mean accuracy of the model on the testing data.
   - Plotted the model's predictions on the testing data to assess its performance.
